                "comment_body": "tldr; Over the past several years, American intellectuals and politicians have been wielding a new term to describe the relationship China has with the United States and the Western world: the Thucydides\u2019 trap. This term, now widely accepted as fact in the US, describes the rise of China and its challenge to the US as the world\u2019s sole superpower as inevitably leading to armed conflict and war. It would be difficult to find an American policy maker who disagrees with the premise or at the least, does not use it. However, the names and concepts we assign to relations between countries have real, tangible impact and inevitably lead us to think in ways that are in agreement with the assigned title. In this case, the potential consequences are immeasurable and a slight misstep by either power could result in devastation for much of the world\u2019s population and economy. It is important to understand that not only is the relationship between the US and China not a Thucydides\u2019 Trap, but that the term itself is irresponsible and risks causing policy makers to sleepwalk the US into conflict with one of the world\u2019s largest military powers.",
