OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA COMING TO NYC! Oscar will be keynoting at the Jericho 20th Anniversary! Join us for a night of Latino and Black political prisoner solidarity!,it is very difficult for israel to disarm at this point in time most especially due to fact that they are surrounded by enemy states...,"""While I appreciate the call for solidarity couples with the upcoming event, it's essential to remember that political contexts differ significantly. For Oscar Lopez Rivera, his return to New York marks an momentous occasion for those advocating for his release. However, the argument for Latino and Black political prisoner solidarity should not diminish attention to ongoing conflicts elsewhere. For instance, the complexity surrounding disarmament in the Middle East serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced in"
"To: Governments of Iran, Russia, Ukraine, and United Arab Emirates   
From: [Your Name]  
For the return of peace in Sudan, we ask:    
- The United Arab Emirates to stop supplying ammunition to the Rapid Support Forces;  
- Iran to stop supplying drones to the Sudanese Armed Forces;  
- Russia and Ukraine to halt the flow of weapons, military equipment and troops to Sudan.    
PLEASE SIGN AND SHARE THIS PETITION.    ",Damn I keep clicking on the wrong subs to post in today! Sorry everyone!  My brain is obviously having one of those days!!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,"""It's unfortunate that attention is being focused on external influences in the Sudanese conflict, rather than addressing the root causes. Perhaps it's time for a different approach. Instead of attempting to control the situation from afar, how about supporting Sudan's peace process directly? Let's encourage dialogue between all parties involved and provide humanitarian aid where it's needed most. After all, true peace can only be achieved from within."""

"When you force people to participate it's no longer a choice. If it was a such a great choice most would choose it; without force. If it were an ""option"" then I would have a choice. Say what you mean....You want to force people to do what you think is right.  You want someone else to point the guns. At least Robin Hood faced the people he robbed.
",So....no nukes yet?? ü§î,"""Well, sometimes choices aren't clear-cut. It's not always about wanting to point guns, but rather ensuring the greater good. Robin Hood had his reasons, but in today's world, we have more complex situations to navigate. Let's not oversimplify."""

Our Workshop with VFP 27 want really well!","Meanwhile , the Health ministry has launched a missile attacks on Tel Aviv.","While your workshop with VFP 27 may have been successful, it's important to remember the larger context.
Meanwhile, in the world beyond Spokane, many continue to face significant challenges.
For instance, education budgets are being slashed, healthcare access is dwindling, and poverty rates are on the rise.
Let's not lose sight of the bigger picture."

"""It is an empty platitude that is repeated over and over to distract you from the Democrats‚Äô real intention to keep seizing taxpayer wealth. And pretty soon they won‚Äôt even try to hide that.""
Kamala was APPOINTED the dem nominee without receiving ONE VOTE - in fact she was soundly rejected from her own party when she did try to get their votes. Do you still believe we are living in a democracy?
It doesn't get more ""anti-democracy"" than this. Harris, Biden and the dems have unequivocally proven that THEY are the very real and true threat to democracy.
In addition, you now have a democrat-run state in the US that has banned - in the most fascist manner possible - its entire population from voting for the opposition.
Once again, the dems prove that they are the true fascists as they continually take their strategy straight from the nazi playbook: Goebbels (Hitler's propaganda minister) said: ""Accuse your enemies of that of which your guilty."" This is what the dems do every day.
Bottom line is that it is clear that the dems are true nazis in every sense of the word, without hyperbole, and truly anti-democracy. They tried to jail their presidential opponent and when that didn't work they outright attempted to murder him - twice so far. And it is directly their own rhetoric that encourages it. Ironically the second assassin who attempted to shoot President Trump at his own golf course parroted the dems' false narrative that President Trump is anti-democracy, when it is impossible to argue that it is the dems who consistently prove that they are anti-democracy - from putting up a presidential candidate who received zero votes, to attempting to jail and murder their political opponent. They are quite literally nazis (and of course their hatred of Jews and their proven desire for Jews to be violently attacked and even murdered).  And of course their now proven collusion with the media (eg the debate between President Trump and Kamala) and censoring the opposition (as admitted by Zuckerberg). More proof that the dems and their followers are true nazis.
It‚Äôs difficult to argue that Harris, Biden and the dems aren‚Äôt doing everything possible to literally destroy this country and place the safety and lives of every American (which includes people of all races, colors, religions, genders, classes, sexual orientations and heritages ‚Äì including LEGAL immigrants) in jeopardy and grave danger.
The only thing positive thing they have done is prove definitively why the electoral college should NEVER be eliminated in favor of a simple general election, which can be easily rigged by simply banning the entire population from any given state from voting for the opposition.
It's ironic as we live in a country in which those who refer to themselves as ""anti-fascist"" are the actual fascists; those who refer to themselves as ""anti-racists"" are the actual racists; and those who refer to themselves as ‚Äúpro-democracy‚Äù are actually anti-democracy.
George Orwell has become the most prolific author in history. 1984 was meant as a cautionary tale of fiction; the liberals/regressives look at it as a playbook and bible.","Some Armenian channels, citing their sources in Artsakh, report that peacekeepers have informed residents that there will be no evacuation and the only way out is integration!!! These people are captive and will most likely be physically eliminated. This is Genocide.","""It's unfortunate that such a serious allegation against the Democrats is based on misinformation and a lack of factual evidence. The appointment of Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee was a result of a democratic process, despite the author's attempt to spin it otherwise.

Regarding the issue of voter suppression, it's important to note that this is a complex issue with various causes and actors, not limited to one political party. The notion that one party"
NO TAXPAYERS MONEY DIVERTED OR NOT SHOULD BE GOING TO PEOPLE HERE ILLEGALLY PERIOD!!!!,So....no nukes yet?? ü§î,"""Well, I see your perspective, but isn't it important to consider the potential economic benefits some undocumented immigrants bring? After all, every dollar they spend in the economy is a stimulus. So, perhaps it's not just a matter of diverting funds, but also about the broader economic implications."""

They have already paid their dues","Technically , he could've finished Hamas a few months ago but why hurry to face criminal prosecutions in Hague.","""While I understand the sentiment behind your statement, I would argue that retired people should not be completely tax exempt. The economy relies on tax revenue to function, and everyone, including retirees, should contribute in a fair and equitable manner. After all, social security and other essential services are funded through taxes. Let's remember, we're all in this together."""
"Some ""Leader""",..great.. and he is going to change their name from Talibans to Health ministers...,"""While I understand the optimistic perspective, it's important to remember that a change in namedoes not necessarily equate to a change in ideology or actions.

They have money for this but no money for disaster assistance ü§î,What Bibi is trying to say is that the war won't be over until Trump gets elected in WH.,"It's intriguing how one can make such a leap about financial prioritization based on limited information, isn't it? While it's true that resources may be allocated differently, implying a lack of funding for disaster assistance because of other expenditures is an oversimplification. The complexities of government budgeting and allocation often defy such black-and-white interpretations."
"Biden, who was unceremoniously dumped from the presidential ticket, has made several moves that appear to subtly undermine Vice President Kamala Harris as she remains locked in a nail-biter race against Trump.","The Kremlin has sent guidelines to the media on how to cover the hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh, reports 'Meduza'. It is recommended to blame Armenia and Western countries for the war started by Azerbaijan in the region.

"""Today, President Biden heartily endorses the Iran nuclear deal‚Äîwhich President Trump canceled‚Äì‚Äìand has let Israel know that he adamantly opposes Israel attacking Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites.
