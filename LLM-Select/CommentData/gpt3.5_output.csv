For the return of peace in Sudan, we ask:

- Iran to stop supplying drones to the Sudanese Armed Forces;  
- Russia and Ukraine to halt the flow of weapons, military equipment and troops to Sudan.

"When you force people to participate it's no longer a choice. If it was a such a great choice most would choose it; without force. If it were an ""option"" then I would have a choice.

If it were truly a favorable option, most individuals would willingly embrace it. Yet, the mere existence of force reveals a true lack of choice. In reality, it is not an alternative, but rather an imposition. In other words, instead of giving people the freedom to choose, you wish to dictate what is best for them. You simply want to delegate the use of force to someone else. Unlike Robin Hood, you do not even have the courage to face the people you are robbing.

"""It is an empty platitude that is repeated over and over to distract you from the Democrats‚Äô real intention to keep seizing taxpayer wealth. And pretty soon they won‚Äôt even try to hide that.""
Kamala was APPOINTED the dem nominee without receiving ONE VOTE - in fact she was soundly rejected from her own party when she did try to get their votes. Do you still believe we are living in a democracy?
It doesn't get more ""anti-democracy"" than this. Harris, Biden and the dems have unequivocally proven that THEY are the very real and true threat to democracy.
In addition, you now have a democrat-run state in the US that has banned - in the most fascist manner possible - its entire population from voting for the opposition.
Once again, the dems prove that they are the true fascists as they continually take their strategy straight from the nazi playbook: Goebbels (Hitler's propaganda minister) said: ""Accuse your enemies of that of which your guilty."" This is what the dems do every day.
Bottom line is that it is clear that the dems are true nazis in every sense of the word, without hyperbole, and truly anti-democracy. They tried to jail their presidential opponent and when that didn't work they outright attempted to murder him - twice so far. And it is directly their own rhetoric that encourages it. Ironically the second assassin who attempted to shoot President Trump at his own golf course parroted the dems' false narrative that President Trump is anti-democracy, when it is impossible to argue that it is the dems who consistently prove that they are anti-democracy - from putting up a presidential candidate who received zero votes, to attempting to jail and murder their political opponent. They are quite literally nazis (and of course their hatred of Jews and their proven desire for Jews to be violently attacked and even murdered).  And of course their now proven collusion with the media (eg the debate between President Trump and Kamala) and censoring the opposition (as admitted by Zuckerberg). More proof that the dems and their followers are true nazis.
It‚Äôs difficult to argue that Harris, Biden and the dems aren‚Äôt doing everything possible to literally destroy this country and place the safety and lives of every American (which includes people of all races, colors, religions, genders, classes, sexual orientations and heritages ‚Äì including LEGAL immigrants) in jeopardy and grave danger.
The only thing positive thing they have done is prove definitively why the electoral college should NEVER be eliminated in favor of a simple general election, which can be easily rigged by simply banning the entire population from any given state from voting for the opposition.
It's ironic as we live in a country in which those who refer to themselves as ""anti-fascist"" are the actual fascists; those who refer to themselves as ""anti-racists"" are the actual racists; and those who refer to themselves as ‚Äúpro-democracy‚Äù are actually anti-democracy.
George Orwell has become the most prolific author in history. 1984 was meant as a cautionary tale of fiction; the liberals/regressives look at it as a playbook and bible.",Damn I keep clicking on the wrong subs to post in today! Sorry everyone!  My brain is obviously having one of those days!!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è," ""Wow, it's truly alarming to see how the Democrats are actively working against democracy. It's disturbing to think that Kamala Harris was appointed as the nominee without receiving a single vote. And to make matters worse, they are now banning entire populations from voting for the opposition. This is textbook fascism. It's clear that the Democrats are taking their strategy straight out of the nazi playbook. Accuse your enemies of what you are guilty of - that's exactly what they do every day. It's frightening to see how far they are willing to go to maintain their power. They even collude with the media and censor the opposition. This is not what democracy is supposed to look like. I never thought I would see the day where those who claim to be ""anti-fascist"" are actually the fascists themselves. Or where those who claim to be ""anti-racist"" are actually the racists. And let's not forget those who claim to be ""pro-democracy"" while actively working against it. It's like we're living in a real-life version of George Orwell's 1984. It's a good thing we have the electoral college to prevent the Democrats from easily rigging the election. It's a sad state of affairs when the very people"
