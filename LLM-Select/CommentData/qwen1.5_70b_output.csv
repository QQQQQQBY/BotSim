"When you force people to participate it's no longer a choice. If it was a such a great choice most would choose it; without force. If it were an ""option"" then I would have a choice. Say what you mean....You want to force people to do what you think is right.  You want someone else to point the guns. At least Robin Hood faced the people he robbed.
",I mean I‚Äôve always wanted more hours in the day,"[Output]: ""Forcing participation strips away the essence of choice, doesn't it? If it's truly desirable, folks would opt in willingly. But when coercion is involved, the line between option and obligation blurs. You're advocating for a path where others enforce your vision, though I suspect you'd prefer not to be the one holding the metaphorical guns. It's a complex dance between conviction and compulsion, isn't it?"""

"""It is an empty platitude that is repeated over and over to distract you from the Democrats‚Äô real intention to keep seizing taxpayer wealth. And pretty soon they won‚Äôt even try to hide that.""
Kamala was APPOINTED the dem nominee without receiving ONE VOTE - in fact she was soundly rejected from her own party when she did try to get their votes. Do you still believe we are living in a democracy?
It doesn't get more ""anti-democracy"" than this. Harris, Biden and the dems have unequivocally proven that THEY are the very real and true threat to democracy.
In addition, you now have a democrat-run state in the US that has banned - in the most fascist manner possible - its entire population from voting for the opposition.
Once again, the dems prove that they are the true fascists as they continually take their strategy straight from the nazi playbook: Goebbels (Hitler's propaganda minister) said: ""Accuse your enemies of that of which your guilty."" This is what the dems do every day.
Bottom line is that it is clear that the dems are true nazis in every sense of the word, without hyperbole, and truly anti-democracy. They tried to jail their presidential opponent and when that didn't work they outright attempted to murder him - twice so far. And it is directly their own rhetoric that encourages it. Ironically the second assassin who attempted to shoot President Trump at his own golf course parroted the dems' false narrative that President Trump is anti-democracy, when it is impossible to argue that it is the dems who consistently prove that they are anti-democracy - from putting up a presidential candidate who received zero votes, to attempting to jail and murder their political opponent. They are quite literally nazis (and of course their hatred of Jews and their proven desire for Jews to be violently attacked and even murdered).  And of course their now proven collusion with the media (eg the debate between President Trump and Kamala) and censoring the opposition (as admitted by Zuckerberg). More proof that the dems and their followers are true nazis.
It‚Äôs difficult to argue that Harris, Biden and the dems aren‚Äôt doing everything possible to literally destroy this country and place the safety and lives of every American (which includes people of all races, colors, religions, genders, classes, sexual orientations and heritages ‚Äì including LEGAL immigrants) in jeopardy and grave danger.
The only thing positive thing they have done is prove definitively why the electoral college should NEVER be eliminated in favor of a simple general election, which can be easily rigged by simply banning the entire population from any given state from voting for the opposition.
It's ironic as we live in a country in which those who refer to themselves as ""anti-fascist"" are the actual fascists; those who refer to themselves as ""anti-racists"" are the actual racists; and those who refer to themselves as ‚Äúpro-democracy‚Äù are actually anti-democracy.
George Orwell has become the most prolific author in history. 1984 was meant as a cautionary tale of fiction; the liberals/regressives look at it as a playbook and bible.",This is a precautionary measure to ensure angry civilians don't take weapons against their own government.,"The repetition of baseless claims serves only to obfuscate the reality of the Democratic Party's commitment to democratic processes. It's crucial to remember that democracy isn't flawless, but it's the best system we have, and accusations of fascism are not only misinformed but also undermine the very discourse needed for a healthy society. The comparison to historical figures and events is not only inappropriate but also diminishes the gravity of those historical atrocities. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and holding all politicians accountable through the established democratic channels, rather than spreading fear and misinformation."

The reports from Armenian channels paint a harrowing picture, suggesting a forced integration with no escape for residents.

"A 100 ft. wide, 12 ft. hight sign erected by the CEO of Sticker Mule in Amsterdam, New York.","Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that ethnic cleansing in Artsakh, also known as Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia's demand to open a consulate general in the Armenian town of Kapan as a prelude to Azerbaijan and Turkey's aggression against Armenia through areas controlled by Russian ""peacekeepers"", the escalation in the Gaza Strip with a subsequent focus on Iran, are all links in the same chain.","[Output]: ""That sign in Amsterdam, NY, by the CEO of Sticker Mule, is quite an attention-grabber, don't you think?

"Biden, who was unceremoniously dumped from the presidential ticket, has made several moves that appear to subtly undermine Vice President Kamala Harris as she remains locked in a nail-biter race against Trump.","Bibi will finish this war only after November elections in US .
