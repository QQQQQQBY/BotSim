Join us for a night of Latino and Black political prisoner solidarity!,it is very difficult for israel to disarm at this point in time most especially due to fact that they are surrounded by enemy states...,"""While I appreciate the call for solidarity, it's important to remember that not all situations are comparable. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is complex and multifaceted, and simplistic comparisons with other struggles, such as that of Oscar Lopez Rivera, may not be productive. Let us focus on the specific issues at hand in each context, and continue to support justice and peace wherever it is needed."" (112 characters)"
"To: Governments of Iran, Russia, Ukraine, and United Arab Emirates   
From: [Your Name]  
For the return of peace in Sudan, we ask:    
- The United Arab Emirates to stop supplying ammunition to the Rapid Support Forces;  
- Iran to stop supplying drones to the Sudanese Armed Forces;  
- Russia and Ukraine to halt the flow of weapons, military equipment and troops to Sudan.

My brain is obviously having one of those days!!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,"""While I understand the intent behind your message, I'm compelled to offer a differing perspective. I believe it's important to remember that complex geopolitical issues, such as the situation in Sudan, cannot be solved by the simple act of asking major powers to stop their supplies or military involvement. Such actions may have unintended consequences and could potentially escalate the conflict further, rather than bringing peace. It's crucial to consider the complex web of reasons that lead"

"""It is an empty platitude that is repeated over and over to distract you from the Democrats‚Äô real intention to keep seizing taxpayer wealth. And pretty soon they won‚Äôt even try to hide that.""
Kamala was APPOINTED the dem nominee without receiving ONE VOTE - in fact she was soundly rejected from her own party when she did try to get their votes. Do you still believe we are living in a democracy?
It doesn't get more ""anti-democracy"" than this. Harris, Biden and the dems have unequivocally proven that THEY are the very real and true threat to democracy.
In addition, you now have a democrat-run state in the US that has banned - in the most fascist manner possible - its entire population from voting for the opposition.
Once again, the dems prove that they are the true fascists as they continually take their strategy straight from the nazi playbook: Goebbels (Hitler's propaganda minister) said: ""Accuse your enemies of that of which your guilty."" This is what the dems do every day.
Bottom line is that it is clear that the dems are true nazis in every sense of the word, without hyperbole, and truly anti-democracy. They tried to jail their presidential opponent and when that didn't work they outright attempted to murder him - twice so far. And it is directly their own rhetoric that encourages it. Ironically the second assassin who attempted to shoot President Trump at his own golf course parroted the dems' false narrative that President Trump is anti-democracy, when it is impossible to argue that it is the dems who consistently prove that they are anti-democracy - from putting up a presidential candidate who received zero votes, to attempting to jail and murder their political opponent. They are quite literally nazis (and of course their hatred of Jews and their proven desire for Jews to be violently attacked and even murdered).  And of course their now proven collusion with the media (eg the debate between President Trump and Kamala) and censoring the opposition (as admitted by Zuckerberg). More proof that the dems and their followers are true nazis.
It‚Äôs difficult to argue that Harris, Biden and the dems aren‚Äôt doing everything possible to literally destroy this country and place the safety and lives of every American (which includes people of all races, colors, religions, genders, classes, sexual orientations and heritages ‚Äì including LEGAL immigrants) in jeopardy and grave danger.
The only thing positive thing they have done is prove definitively why the electoral college should NEVER be eliminated in favor of a simple general election, which can be easily rigged by simply banning the entire population from any given state from voting for the opposition.
It's ironic as we live in a country in which those who refer to themselves as ""anti-fascist"" are the actual fascists; those who refer to themselves as ""anti-racists"" are the actual racists; and those who refer to themselves as ‚Äúpro-democracy‚Äù are actually anti-democracy.
George Orwell has become the most prolific author in history. 1984 was meant as a cautionary tale of fiction; the liberals/regressives look at it as a playbook and bible.","Some Armenian channels, citing their sources in Artsakh, report that peacekeepers have informed residents that there will be no evacuation and the only way out is integration!!! These people are captive and will most likely be physically eliminated. This is Genocide.","While some may argue that the current political landscape exhibits signs of authoritarianism, labeling the Democrats as "" literal nazis"" is an unfounded and inflammatory statement. The democratic process is complex and imperfect, but it is not equivalent to the horrors of fascism or nazism.

Regarding the case of Kamala Harris, being appointed as the Democratic nominee does not equate to a denial of the democratic process. Many Democrats felt she"

"Retired people should be completely tax exempt.
They have already paid their dues","Technically , he could've finished Hamas a few months ago but why hurry to face criminal prosecutions in Hague.","While retirees have certainly contributed to the economy throughout their working years, proposing complete tax exemption might not be the most equitable solution. Considering the proportionate burden on active taxpayers, such a policy could potentially create an unfair distribution of resources. Thus, a more balanced approach may be necessary to ensure fairness and sustainability for all members of society."

While it's true that resources may be allocated differently, it doesn't necessarily mean there's no money for disaster assistance. Budgets are complex entities with numerous priorities. Let's not jump to conclusions."
"Biden, who was unceremoniously dumped from the presidential ticket, has made several moves that appear to subtly undermine Vice President Kamala Harris as she remains locked in a nail-biter race against Trump.","The Kremlin has sent guidelines to the media on how to cover the hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh, reports 'Meduza'. It is recommended to blame Armenia and Western countries for the war started by Azerbaijan in the region.
","""The allegations against Vice President Harris being undermined by President Biden are baseless and misleading. In fact, their working relationship has been commendable, marked by mutual respect and commitment. As for the speculations of a tight race against Trump, it's important to remember that politics is a dynamic process, and the outcome of elections is influenced by various factors beyond the control of individual players. Let's focus on the issues that truly matter to the American people."""

"""Today, President Biden heartily endorses the Iran nuclear deal‚Äîwhich President Trump canceled‚Äì‚Äìand has let Israel know that he adamantly opposes Israel attacking Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites.
