l7ob4pf,tqjwp9hc,user_42486,1,"Brazilian soccer star Lucas Paquetá, a midfielder for the English Premier League’s West Ham United and Brazil’s national team, is being investigated for alleged involvement in a betting scandal. So far, the investigation hasn’t hampered his chances of playing in this month’s Copa América.

In late May, England’s soccer governing body, the Football Association (FA), formally charged Paquetá and is reportedly pushing to ban him for life from the sport.

The body alleges that Paquetá intentionally received four yellow cards in different games to influence the betting market, benefiting one or more individuals.",t3_1db3bfm,t3_1db3bfm,GlobalTalk,2024-06-08 21:46:05,1.0

One of the defining relationships of the 21st century will be that between India and the United States. Having overcome the [~“hesitations of history”~](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-indian-pm-burnishes-his-standing-with-address-to-congress-at-11-a-m-et), the world’s oldest and largest democracies have finally embraced each other in pursuing stronger ties across defense, trade, science, and many other spheres. However, for the partnership to escape the trap of empty rhetoric and truly deliver, it must be guided by a cohesive vision. Such a vision must outline the most consequential areas of cooperation which maximize the returns for both partners and the world at large. ",t3_1d99iw1,t3_1d99iw1,GlobalTalk,2024-06-06 12:12:20,1.0
l6n0m2f,5cj3dnb8,user_38434,0,"tldr; Over the past several years, American intellectuals and politicians have been wielding a new term to describe the relationship China has with the United States and the Western world: the Thucydides’ trap. This term, now widely accepted as fact in the US, describes the rise of China and its challenge to the US as the world’s sole superpower as inevitably leading to armed conflict and war. It would be difficult to find an American policy maker who disagrees with the premise or at the least, does not use it. However, the names and concepts we assign to relations between countries have real, tangible impact and inevitably lead us to think in ways that are in agreement with the assigned title. In this case, the potential consequences are immeasurable and a slight misstep by either power could result in devastation for much of the world’s population and economy. It is important to understand that not only is the relationship between the US and China not a Thucydides’ Trap, but that the term itself is irresponsible and risks causing policy makers to sleepwalk the US into conflict with one of the world’s largest military powers.",t3_1d5pxjw,t3_1d5pxjw,worldnews,2024-06-01 23:48:24,1.0
